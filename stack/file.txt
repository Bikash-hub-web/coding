Object detection methods aim to identify all target objects in the target image 
and determine the categories and position information in order to achieve machine vision understanding. 
 
Numerous approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, 
mainly inspired by methods of computer vision and deep learning. However, 
existing approaches always perform poorly for the detection of small, dense objects, 
and even fail to detect objects with random geometric transformations. 

In this study, we compare and analyse mainstream object detection algorithms and
propose a multi-scaled deformable Spectral signature of object detection network to deal with the 
challenges faced by current methods. 

Our analysis demonstrates a strong performance on par, or even better, than state of the art methods. 
We use deep convolutional networks to obtain multi-scaled features, and add deformable 
convolutional structures to overcome geometric transformations. 

We then fuse the multi-scaled features by up sampling, in order to implement 
the final object recognition and region regress. Experiments prove that our suggested framework 
improves the accuracy of detecting small target objects with geometric deformation, showing significant 
improvements in the trade-off between accuracy and speed.
